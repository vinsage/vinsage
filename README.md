- 👋 Hi, I’m @vinsage
- 👀 I'm trying to add a few coding skills to my resume to make it seem sophisticated, but I'm a lazy and uninspired programmer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️In order to avoid impostor syndrome among my coding pals, I'm hoping to cooperate on any project that can boost my confidence a bit.
